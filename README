--- Original README as per source ---
xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)).  See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/, which provides
pointers to on-line resources for v6.

locking), Cliff Frey (MP), Xiao Yu (MP), Nickolai Zeldovich, and Austin
Clements.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu).  The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.1810, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu.  Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".

## Priority-Based Scheduler for xv6-riscv

This repo modifies xv6-riscv to add a simple static priority scheduler with two syscalls:
- setpriority(int prio): set the calling process's priority to PRIO_MIN..PRIO_MAX
- getpriority(void): get the calling process's current priority

Priorities are integers in [PRIO_MIN, PRIO_MAX] defined in `kernel/param.h`. Higher value means higher priority. Newly created processes start with `PRIO_DEFAULT` and children inherit the parent’s current priority at fork.

### Build and Run (If you are a windows user, you can use WSL + QEMU)

Prereqs installed 
- RISC-V toolchain
- QEMU >= 7.2

Steps:
1) Clean and build 
   make clean && make -j

2) Run xv6 in QEMU
   make qemu

3) In the xv6 shell, run the tests:
   prio_basic
   prio_stress
   prio_edge

What to Expect

- prio_basic: Three children (LOW/MID/HIGH) do short CPU work. With strict priority, HIGH should finish first, then MID, then LOW.
- prio_stress: Spawns 50 short-running children with varying priorities to stress process creation/scheduling.
- prio_edge: Validates error handling for out-of-range priorities and shows get/set behavior.

### Implementation Touchpoints

* Added priority field to `struct proc` and constants in `kernel/param.h`.
* Modified `scheduler()` in `kernel/proc.c` to always select the highest-priority RUNNABLE process.
* New syscalls:
  - Numbers in `kernel/syscall.h`
  - Wiring in `kernel/syscall.c`
  - Implementations in `kernel/sysproc.c`
  - Stubs in `user/usys.pl`, prototypes in `user/user.h`
* Tests in `user/prio_basic.c`, `user/prio_stress.c`, `user/prio_edge.c`
* Wired tests into build via `Makefile` UPROGS.

Notes
-----
This is a minimal teaching implementation. It does not implement aging or fairness; lower-priority jobs may starve if higher-priority jobs remain RUNNABLE.
